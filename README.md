## Multi-Cultivator_Analysis

The Multi-Cultivator_Analysis.ipynb script was used to plot and analyse data from the *Multi-Cultivator MC 1000-OD* cultivation system. The corresponding data is shown in Figure 3F.

## Growth Rate Analysis

We added two growth rate analysis scripts, one containing the analysis logic only (`Growth_Rate.ipynb`) and one containing also the underlying time-lapse videos (`Growth_Rate_with_videos.ipynb`). The jupyter kernel needs to trusted in order to play the videos.
